# Trajectory-Tracking-of-3D-Quadrotor-using-PID-and-LQR-Controller
Overview
This project implements and compares PID and LQR controllers for trajectory tracking of a 3D quadrotor. The controllers are evaluated on their ability to follow circular and diamond-shaped helix trajectories.
Project Scope
The study focuses on analyzing the effectiveness of these control techniques in three key areas:

Accurate trajectory tracking
System stability
Real-world performance characteristics

Constraints and Assumptions

No aggressive motion involving large roll, pitch, or yaw angles
The quadrotor state maintains hovering condition throughout the trajectory

Control Methods
The project implements two control strategies:

PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) Controller
LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator) Controller

Trajectory Types
The controllers are tested on two distinct trajectory patterns:

Circular helix
Diamond-shaped helix

Technical Details
The study evaluates controller performance under standard operating conditions, focusing on practical applications where maintaining stable flight characteristics is essential.
